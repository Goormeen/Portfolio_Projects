## Business Insights:
### 1. Product Performance
Top Seller: Jackets dominate revenue at €26.58M, accounting for ~68% of total sales — this is a clear hero category.

Mid-Tier Sellers: Sweaters (€4.09M), shoes (€3.75M), t-shirts (€3.7M), and jeans (€0.86M) lag far behind jackets.

#### Suggestions:

Leverage Jackets’ Success: Launch more jacket variations (colors, seasonal designs, sustainable fabrics) to capitalize on the strong demand.

Boost Low Performers: Evaluate marketing, pricing, and placement strategies for jeans and t-shirts — their sales contribution is minimal despite potentially high appeal.

Consider bundling low-performing items with best-sellers to increase turnover.

### 2. Section Insights (MAN vs. WOMAN)
Average revenue is significantly higher in the MAN section compared to WOMAN.

#### Suggestions:

Increase product variety and marketing campaigns in the MAN section, as this audience seems to have higher spending potential.

Review women’s section assortment — possible gaps in style, pricing, or promotions might be causing lower engagement.

### 3. Seasonal & Promotion Analysis
Seasonal products and promotions show a slight revenue boost — seasonal “Yes” and promotion “True” both outperform their counterparts by a small margin.

#### Suggestions:

Expand seasonal collections and ensure they are well-promoted.

Use promotions strategically — perhaps focus them on non-peak seasons to smooth out demand rather than eroding margin in already high-selling months.

See whether promotions help break even or not.
### 4. Product Position Impact
Front-of-store and aisle placement generates the highest average revenue, followed by end-cap.

#### Suggestions:

Place new arrivals and high-margin products at the front of the store or in the aisle to maximize visibility and impulse buys.

Consider testing different positioning for low sellers like jeans to improve exposure.

### 5. Overall Recommendations
Data driven merchandising: Continue tracking category-specific performance to adjust stock allocation dynamically.

Cross-category marketing: Use jackets’ popularity to cross-sell complementary products.

Targeted promotions: Focus discounts on underperforming items rather than across the board.

Category expansion: Develop mid-range performers (shoes, t-shirts) through targeted campaigns, limited editions, and influencer collaborations.

Pricing strategy: Test whether higher jacket prices maintain demand; even a 2–3% increase could yield significant extra revenue without adding volume.
